# Laboratory-Comprehensive-Management-System
System Introduction
The laboratory comprehensive management system is a full process management platform that integrates informatization, intelligence, and standardization, aiming to improve the safety management level and operational efficiency of universities, research institutes, and enterprise laboratories.

The system is based on the core concept of "data-driven, intelligent control, and closed-loop management", comprehensively covering user service management portal, laboratory basic information management, laboratory setting and adjustment, safety risk grading, instrument and equipment lifecycle management, low value consumables management system, hazardous chemical management system (hazardous waste treatment), large-scale instrument management system, intelligent IoT management system, laboratory safety management system (safety education examination and admission module, safety inspection management module, laboratory (project) risk assessment module, gas cylinder management system, special equipment management system, laboratory safety and system related module linkage, laboratory safety facility linkage module), data reporting and analysis system, mobile end and other core business scenarios.

By building a unified data center and business center, the system achieves deep integration with multiple platforms such as access control, video surveillance, IoT sensors, and educational systems, supporting collaborative operations between PC and mobile devices, and promoting the transformation and upgrading of laboratory management from "human defense" to "technical defense+intelligent defense". The system is equipped with an AI analysis model and risk warning mechanism, which can intelligently identify and proactively warn of abnormal behavior, overdue rectification of hidden dangers, and other situations, helping laboratory safety management achieve visualization, refinement, and intelligence.

This system has been successfully implemented and applied in multiple universities and research institutions, significantly improving the efficiency of laboratory safety supervision and providing a solid security guarantee for teaching and research activities.

The system adopts a modular design approach

Following the design concept of "plug and play, modular", with "component embedded" as the specific application mode, it has customized functions and can seamlessly integrate various business data and management subsystems according to the specific needs of users without changing the source code.
